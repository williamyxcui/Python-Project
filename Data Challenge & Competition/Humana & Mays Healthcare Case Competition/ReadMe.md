# TOP50 in US - 2019 Humana & Mays Healthcare Case Competition
This folder contains code solutions for the healthcare case competition. Thanks my partner Wendy`s contribution. It is a challenge for us but we insist and get some achievement.
# Challenging Problem
1.Correctly identify & label events of interest initial opioid therapies for Opioid Na√Øve population and LTOT
2.Feature Engineering Data are not analysis ready. Participants will have to clean and extract features based on longitudinal events
3.Ability to Apply Model Round 1 judging will be solely based model performance demonstrated on holdout sample
# Solutions
1.This is a complex data challenge. Data preprocessing and problem analyze are very improtant.
2.The first step is to corectly identify the LTOT based on the requirement proposed in the introduction. There are two vital keys: naive period and Opioid period. One person can have more than 1 navie and opioid period. Therefore, the key to solve this data challenge is to identify the two period.

# File Introdction
1. The first file is to find the first period and decide the patient is opioid or not.

# Note
Since the NDA, the dataset and dataset infomation will not be shown in the folder
